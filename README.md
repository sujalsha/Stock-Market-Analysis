# Stock Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing stock data using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express. The dataset includes historical stock prices for various tickers, and the analysis covers tasks such as time series visualization, moving average calculation, daily returns computation, and correlation analysis between different stocks.

## Features

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Utilizes Pandas to read and explore the structure of the stock dataset.
   - Checks for missing values and displays the first few rows of the data.

2. **Time Series Visualization:**
   - Uses Plotly Express to create interactive line plots for the closing prices of each stock over time.
   
3. **Moving Averages:**
   - Calculates and visualizes moving averages (10, 20, and 30 days) for each stock.

4. **Daily Returns:**
   - Computes daily returns as the percentage change in closing prices.
   - Presents line plots and histograms to visualize the distribution of daily returns.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examines the pairwise correlation between daily returns of different stocks.
   - Creates a Seaborn pairplot for a comprehensive visualization.
